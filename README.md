## Overview
The main purpose of our project was to re-present familiar games to users by developing them with innovative ideas. We aimed for a project that detects hand movements instead of the keyboard and offers the opportunity to experience games in a virtual world.
We used Python language in this project. We used pygame, opencv, mediapipe, streamlit libraries.

Now I would like to briefly talk about our games:

ðŸ“Œ Our first game, "Catching Fish", is a game that aims to catch Nemo fish. This game has been carefully designed to provide a fun experience.

ðŸ“Œ Our next game is "Fruit Ninja". We all know this game. It is a game generally played on the phone. However, in this project, we can use two hands, so we aimed to provide more interactivity to users.

ðŸ“Œ The last game is the Tetris game. We combined this game, which has been played since the past, with today's technologies. In this game, we test the ability to move blocks using hand movements.
We aimed to offer a unique gaming experience by combining the classic Tetris experience with hand guidance.
